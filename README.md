## Hydrosense
We've developed a robust water quality monitoring system that is not only easy to build, maintain, and upgrade but also empowers users with comprehensive data insights. The system integrates hardware components to gather data on various water parameters, assessing water quality. The smart visualization dashboard, enhanced by AI, provides seamless web access. Utilizing Cloud technology ensures efficient data flow from IoT devices to the dashboard, making it accessible through a user application. Our primary goal is to create a user-friendly system tailored for students across India, offering a compelling interface for easy navigation, constructive learning, and heightened awareness. This project was undertaken as part of the Smart India Hackathon.
